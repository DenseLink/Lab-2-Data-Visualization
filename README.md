# Lab 2: Data Visualization

## Description
This repository contains the source code and documentation for Lab 2 of the Data Visualization course. The lab focuses on implementing various data visualization techniques using C++. The source code is structured into a main application (`main.cpp` and `main.h`), demonstrating the practical application of these techniques.
